## Why do I write this blog?
<p class="lead">  
I love expressing my opinion by writing. Writing improves my vocabulary. It can also make my life less boring during my stay in Japan (Since 2021). 
</p>  

>  I started TFD in 2014 when I was in grade 11. I didn't know much about computers at that time, let alone how to edit and produce a proper video.

The only knowledge I can share at that time (2014) was `English`. It wasn't perfect. Why did I have such a stomach to leave my comfort zone? I think it has something to do with `motivation`. I always have curiosity about how things work around me. I started a small blog with Google blogger when I was in grade 10. It wasn't a success, but it was fun. I learned about `html` and how to style my element. By keep doing this over and over, I gained knowledge and perfection along the way. I wasn't even aware of that. I hope this blog can inspire the younger generation to seek positive development in life.
